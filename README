README
    This file.

kernel/
    This is the directory that contains the source code for your
    operating system.  Currently, a skeleton is provided that will build
    and boot you into protected mode, printing out various boot
    parameters.  Read the INSTALL file in that directory for
    instructions on how to set up the bootloader to boot this OS.
